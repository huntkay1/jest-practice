This project was created to practice using Jest, creating tests, and taking advantage of 
Test-Driven Development practices. 

I created four modules and the corresponding tests:
- Uppercase: takes a string and capitalizes the first letter
- Reverse: takes a string and reverses it
- Calculator: an object that contains the basic calculations. Takes to numbers and returns the calcuation
- Caeser Cypher: takes a string and a shift (integer). Returns the ciphered string based on the shift.
  - accounts for capital letters, punctuation, and wrapping.
- Analyze Array: takes an array of numbers and returns an object containin the average, min, max, and
  length of the array.
